One On One Chat application | Spring Boot & WebSocket | By Menes

## Overview

Explore the world of **WebSockets** with **Menes**, your experienced software engineer guide. If you missed our previous session delving into the magic of WebSockets and creating a lively group chat application, catch up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T-HnTE6v64&ab_channel=BoualiAli).

Today's focus is on real-time communication, as we build a **one-on-one chat application** that ensures private, secure conversations. Taking it a step further, we'll persist these chats in a **MongoDB database**.

Before diving into the code, a special mention for those keen on deepening their understanding of WebSockets. If you haven't checked out the introduction in the previous video, find the link in the description [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TywlS9iAZCM&t=808s&ab_channel=BoualiAli).
